h1. Introduction

After some weeks of development I am happy to introduce the first public version of "CopyTo".

h1. Installation

The installation is pretty easy using the Eclipse Update Site provided at "http://pke.github.com/CopyTo/update":http://pke.github.com/CopyTo/update.

Just add the site to your Eclipse Update Sites.


h1. Thanks

I wanna thank Remi and Paul Webster for answering my endless questions on the #eclipse IRC channel.
